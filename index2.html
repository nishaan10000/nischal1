      <h2>Death Note</h2>
      <p>
        Death Note (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written by
        Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. The story follows Light
        Yagami, a teen genius who discovers a mysterious notebook: the "Death
        Note", which belonged to the Shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the
        supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages.
        The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death
        Note to carry out a worldwide massacre of individuals whom he deems
        immoral and to create a crime-free society, using the alias of a
        god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent efforts of an elite
        Japanese police task force, led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend
        him. Death Note ran in Shueisha's manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from
        December 2003 to May 2006. Its 108 chapters were collected in 12
        tankōbon volumes.

        A 37-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Madhouse
        and directed by Tetsurō Araki, was broadcast in Japan on Nippon
        Television from October 2006 to June 2007. A light novel based on the
        series, written by Nisio Isin, was also released in 2006. Additionally,
        various video games have been published by Konami for the Nintendo DS.
        The series was adapted into three live action films released in Japan in
        June 2006, November 2006, and February 2008, and a television drama in
        2015. A miniseries titled Death Note: New Generation and a fourth film
        were released in 2016. An American film adaptation was released
        exclusively on Netflix in August 2017 and a sequel is reportedly in the
        works.

        Death Note media, except for video games and soundtracks, is licensed
        and released in North America by Viz Media. The episodes from the anime
        first appeared in North America as downloadable from IGN before Viz
        Media licensed it. The series was aired on YTV's Bionix anime block in
        Canada and on Adult Swim in the United States with a DVD release
        following. The live-action films briefly played in certain North
        American theaters, in 2008, before receiving home video releases. As of
        April 2015, the Death Note manga had over 30 million copies in
        circulation.

      <h2>concept</h2>

      <p>
        The notebooks: <br /><br />
        The core plot device of the story is the "Death Note" itself, a black
        notebook with instructions (known as "Rules of the Death Note") written
        on the inside. When used correctly, it allows anyone to commit a murder,
        knowing only the victim's name and face. According to the director of
        the live-action films, Shusuke Kaneko, "The idea of spirits living in
        words is an ancient Japanese concept.... In a way, it's a very Japanese
        story".
        <br />
        <br />
        Artist Takeshi Obata originally thought of the books as "Something you
        would automatically think was a Death Note". Deciding that this design
        would be cumbersome, he instead opted for a more accessible college
        notebook. Death Notes were originally conceived as changing based on
        time and location, resembling scrolls in ancient Japan, or the Old
        Testament in medieval Europe. However, this idea was never used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Themes: <br /><br />
        Writer Tsugumi Ohba had no particular themes in mind for Death Note.
        When pushed, he suggested: "Humans will all eventually die and never
        come back to life, so let's give it our all while we're alive". He went
        on to say that "no human has the right to pass judgment on another's
        actions. No one should play God". He said that Near's climactic speech
        about good and evil was rooted in his own beliefs.
        <br />
        <br />
        In a 2012 paper, author Jolyon Baraka Thomas characterised Death Note as
        a psychological thriller released in the wake of the 1995 Tokyo subway
        sarin attack, saying that it examines the human tendency to express
        itself through "horrific" cults.

      <p>
        Pilot chapter: <br /><br />
        The Death Note process began when Ohba brought thumbnails for two
        concept ideas to Shueisha; Ohba said that the Death Note pilot, one of
        the concepts, was "received well" by editors and attained positive
        reactions by readers. Ohba described keeping the story of the pilot to
        one chapter as "very difficult", declaring that it took over a month to
        begin writing the chapter. He added that the story had to revive the
        killed characters with the Death Eraser and that he "didn't really care"
        for that plot device.
        <br />
        <br />
        Obata said that he wanted to draw the story after he heard of a "horror
        story featuring Shinigami". According to Obata, when he first received
        the rough draft created by Ohba, he "didn't really get it" at first, and
        he wanted to work on the project due to the presence of Shinigami and
        because the work "was dark". He also said he wondered about the
        progression of the plot as he read the thumbnails, and if Jump readers
        would enjoy reading the comic. Obata said that while there is little
        action and the main character "doesn't really drive the plot", he
        enjoyed the atmosphere of the story. He stated that he drew the pilot
        chapter so that it would appeal to himself.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ohba brought the rough draft of the pilot chapter to the editorial
        department. Obata came into the picture at a later point to create the
        artwork. They did not meet in person while creating the pilot chapter.
        Ohba said that the editor told him he did not need to meet with Obata to
        discuss the pilot; Ohba said "I think it worked out all right".
      </p>
      <p>
        Anime adaptation: <br /><br />Tetsurō Araki, the director, said that he
        wished to convey aspects that "made the series interesting" instead of
        simply "focusing on morals or the concept of justice". Toshiki Inoue,
        the series organizer, agreed with Araki and added that, in anime
        adaptations, there is a lot of importance in highlighting the aspects
        that are "interesting in the original". He concluded that Light's
        presence was "the most compelling" aspect; therefore the adaptation
        chronicles Light's "thoughts and actions as much as possible". Inoue
        noted that to best incorporate the manga's plot into the anime, he
        "tweak[ed] the chronology a bit" and incorporated flashbacks that appear
        after the openings of the episodes; he said this revealed the desired
        tensions. Araki said that, because in an anime the viewer cannot "turn
        back pages" in the manner that a manga reader can, the anime staff
        ensured that the show clarified details. Inoue added that the staff did
        not want to get involved with every single detail, so the staff selected
        elements to emphasize. Due to the complexity of the original manga, he
        described the process as "definitely delicate and a great challenge".
        Inoue admitted that he placed more instructions and notes in the script
        than usual. Araki added that because of the importance of otherwise
        trivial details, this commentary became crucial to the development of
        the series.
        <br />
        <br />
        Araki said that when he discovered the Death Note anime project, he
        "literally begged" to join the production team; when he joined he
        insisted that Inoue should write the scripts. Inoue added that, because
        he enjoyed reading the manga, he wished to use his effort.
