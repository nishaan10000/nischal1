      <h2>Hentai</h2>
      <p>
        Hentai is anime and manga pornography. A loanword from Japanese, the
        original term does not describe a genre of media, but rather an abnormal
        sexual desire or act, as an abbreviation of hentai seiyoku (sexual
        perversion). In addition to anime and manga, hentai works exist in a
        variety of media, including artwork and video games (commonly known as
        eroge).
      </p>
      <p>
        The development of hentai has been influenced by Japanese cultural and
        historical attitudes toward sexuality. Hentai works, which are often
        self-published, form a significant portion of the market for doujin
        works, including doujinshi. Numerous subgenres exist depicting a variety
        of sexual acts and relationships, as well as novel fetishes.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        Hentai is a kanji compound of (hen; 'change' or 'weird') and (tai;
        'appearance' or 'condition'), and means "metamorphosis" or
        "transformation". In sexual contexts, it carries additional meanings of
        "perversion" or "abnormality", especially when used as an adjective; in
        these uses, it is the shortened form of the phrase hentai seiyoku which
        means "sexual perversion". The character hen is catch-all for queerness
        as a peculiarity—it does not carry an explicit sexual reference. While
        the term has expanded in use to cover a range of publications including
        homosexual publications, it remains primarily a heterosexual term, as
        terms indicating homosexuality entered Japan as foreign words. Japanese
        pornographic works are often simply tagged as 18-kin , meaning
        "prohibited to those not yet 18 years old", and seijin manga ( "adult
        manga").[2] Less official terms also in use include ero anime, ero manga
        and the English initialism AV (for "adult video"). Usage of the term
        hentai does not define a genre in Japan.

      <h2>Etymology</h2>
      <p>
        The history of the word hentai has its origins in science and
        psychology. By the middle of the Meiji era, the term appeared in
        publications to describe unusual or abnormal traits, including
        paranormal abilities and psychological disorders. A translation of
        German sexologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's text Psychopathia Sexualis
        originated the concept of hentai seiyoku, as a "perverse or abnormal
        sexual desire",though it was popularized outside psychology, as in the
        case of Mori Ōgai's 1909 novel Vita Sexualis. Continued interest in
        hentai seiyoku resulted in numerous journals and publications on sexual
        advice which circulated in the public, served to establish the sexual
        connotation of hentai as perverse. Any perverse or abnormal act could be
        hentai, such as committing shinjū (love suicide). It was Nakamura
        Kokyo's journal Abnormal Psychology which started the popular sexology
        boom in Japan which would see the rise of other popular journals like
        Sexuality and Human Nature, Sex Research and Sex. Originally, Tanaka
        Kogai wrote articles for Abnormal Psychology, but it would be Tanaka's
        own journal Modern Sexuality which would become one of the most popular
        sources of information about erotic and neurotic expression. Modern
        Sexuality was created to promote fetishism, S&M, and necrophilia as a
        facet of modern life. The ero-guro movement and depiction of perverse,
        abnormal and often erotic undertones were a response to interest in
        hentai seiyoku.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following World War II, Japan took a new interest in sexualization and
        public sexuality. Mark McLelland puts forth the observation that the
        term hentai found itself shortened to "H" and that the English
        pronunciation was "etchi", referring to lewdness and which did not carry
        the stronger connotation of abnormality or perversion. By the 1950s, the
        "hentai seiyoku" publications became their own genre and included fetish
        and homosexual topics. By the 1960s, the homosexual content was dropped
        in favor of subjects like sadomasochism and stories of lesbianism
        targeted to male readers. The late 1960s brought a sexual revolution
        which expanded and solidified the normalizing of the term's identity in
        Japan that continues to exist today through publications such as
        Bessatsu Takarajima's Hentai-san ga iku series.

      <h2>history</h2>
      <p>
        With the usage of hentai as any erotic depiction, the history of these
        depictions is split into their media. Japanese artwork and comics serve
        as the first example of hentai material, coming to represent the iconic
        style after the publication of Azuma Hideo's Cybele in 1979. Hentai
        first appeared in animation in the 1932 film Suzumi-bune by Hakusan
        Kimura, which was seized by police when it was half complete. The
        remnants of the film were donated to the National Film Center in the
        early 21st century. The film has never been viewed by the public.
        However, the 1984 release of Wonderkid's Lolita Anime was the first
        hentai to get a general release, overlooking the erotic and sexual
        depictions in 1969's One Thousand and One Arabian Nights and the
        bare-breasted Cleopatra in 1970's Cleopatra film. Erotic games, another
        area of contention, has its first case of the art style depicting sexual
        acts in 1985's Tenshitachi no Gogo. In each of these mediums, the broad
        definition and usage of the term complicates its historic examination.
