      <h2>About one piece</h2>
      <p>
        One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and
        illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen
        manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual
        chapters compiled into 101 tankōbon volumes as of December 2021. The
        story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained
        the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit.
        With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand
        Line in search of the world's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece"
        in order to become the next King of the Pirates.

        The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival
        film produced by Production I.G, and an anime series produced by Toei
        Animation, which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999. Additionally, Toei
        has developed fourteen animated feature films, one OVA and thirteen
        television specials. Several companies have developed various types of
        merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video
        games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in
        North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by
        Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids
        Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004,
        before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation
        in 2007.

        One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, art,
        characterization, and humor. It has received many awards and is ranked
        by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time.
        Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including
        the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015, One Piece
        set the Guinness World Record for "the most copies published for the
        same comic book series by a single author". It was the best-selling
        manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only
        manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million
        continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only that had
        achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its 100 published
        tankōbon volumes. As of July 2021, One Piece had over 490 million copies
        in circulation in 58 countries and regions worldwide, making it the
        best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series
        printed in book volume. It is also one of the highest-grossing media
        franchises of all time.

      <h2>characters</h2>
      <p>
        The One Piece manga feature an extensive cast of characters created by
        Eiichiro Oda. The series takes place in a fictional universe where vast
        numbers of pirates, soldiers, revolutionaries, and other adventurers
        fight each other, using various superhuman abilities. The majority of
        the characters are human, but the cast also includes dwarfs, giants,
        mermen and mermaids, fishmen,[a] sky people, and minks, and many others.
        Many of the characters possess abilities gained by eating "Devil

        gathers himself a diverse crew, named the Straw Hat Pirates, including:

      <h2>conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Oda revealed that he originally planned One Piece to last five years,
        and that he had already planned the ending. However, he found it would
        take longer than he had expected as Oda realized that he liked the story
        too much to end it in that period of time. In 2016, nineteen years after
        the start of serialization, the author said that the manga has reached
        65% of the story he intends to tell. In July 2018, on the occasion of
        the twenty-first anniversary of One Piece, Oda said that the manga has
        reached 80% of the plot, while in January 2019, he said that One Piece
        is on its way to the conclusion, but that it could exceed the 100th
        volume. In August 2019, Oda said that, according to his predictions, the
        manga will end between 2024 and 2025. However, Oda stated that the
        ending would be what he had decided in the beginning; he is committed to
        seeing it through. In a television special aired in Japan, Oda said he
        would be willing to change the ending if the fans were to be able to
        predict it. In August 2020, Shueisha announced in the year's 35th issue
        of Weekly Shōnen Jump that One Piece was "headed toward the upcoming
        final saga." On January 4, 2021, One Piece reached its thousandth
        chapter.
