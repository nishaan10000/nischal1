      <h2>Naruto</h2>
      <p>
        Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi
        Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks
        recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader
        of his village. The story is told in two parts – the first set in
        Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is
        based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned
        Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the
        following year, and Naruto (1997).

        Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from
        1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes. The
        manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by Pierrot
        and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007;
        the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005
        to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered
        in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English dub
        was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98
        episodes, and then switched over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming
        block in January 2014, starting over from the first episode. The English
        dub is still airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day. Viz Media began
        streaming the anime series on their streaming service Neon Alley in
        December 2012 on 99 episodes, and ended on March 2016, after 338
        episodes. Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies
        and twelve original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related
        merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards
        developed by several companies.

        Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and
        serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The
        anime series began airing in the United States and Canada in 2005, and
        in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The
        films and most OVAs from the series were also released by Viz, with the
        first film premiering in movie theaters. The story of Naruto continues
        with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations:
        Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of following his
        father's.

        Naruto is the fourth best-selling manga series in history having 250
        million copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions,
        with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies
        elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series;
        their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and
        The New York Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume
        won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character
        development, strong storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though
        some felt the fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted that the
        manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references
        from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.

      <h2>characters</h2>
      <p>
        When he created Naruto, Kishimoto looked to other shōnen manga as
        influences for his work and tried to make his characters unique, while
        basing the story on Japanese culture. The separation of the characters
        into different teams was intended to give each group a particular
        flavor. Kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in
        one skill and be talentless in another. He found it difficult to write
        about romance, but emphasized it more in Part II of the manga, beginning
        with volume 28. He introduced villains into the story to have them act
        as a counterpoint to his characters' moral values and clearly illustrate
        their differences. As a result of how the younger characters were
        significantly weaker than the villains, Kishimoto made the ellipsis in
        order to have them age and become stronger during this time.

      <h2>Setting</h2>
      <p>
        Kishimoto made use of the Chinese zodiac tradition, which had a
        long-standing presence in Japan; the zodiac hand signs originate from
        this. When Kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the Naruto
        manga, he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of
        Konoha. The idea of the setting came to him "pretty spontaneously
        without much thought", but admits that the scenery became based on his
        home in the Japanese prefecture of Okayama. Since the storyline does not
        specify when it is set, he was able to include modern elements in the
        series such as convenience stores. He considered including automobiles,
        planes and simple computers, but excluded projectile weapons and
        vehicles from the plot.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        When serialization began, Kishimoto decided the ending would feature a
        fight between two characters: Naruto and Sasuke. However, the writer
        felt the two were not equals as the former was not a victim of war like
        the latter whose family was killed to stop a possible civil war.
        Nagato's arc paved the way for the ending of Naruto to occur. Nagato
        stood out as a villain due to suffering war and killing Naruto's mentor
        Jiraiya. Understanding the fears of war, Naruto's characterization was
        made more complex for him to experience the Fourth Great Shinobi War.
        These events end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato
        in the final battle.

      <p>
        Kishimoto chose Hinata Hyuga as Naruto's romantic partner from the early
        stages of the manga, since Hinata had always respected and admired
        Naruto even before the series' beginning, and Kishimoto felt this meant
        the two of them could build a relationship. When Hinata first appeared,
        Kishimoto thought of expanding romantic plotlines. but decided to leave
        Naruto's maturation through romance as an idea for the film 2014 The
        Last: Naruto the Movie where he worked alongside screenwriter Maruo
        Kyozuka, a writer more skilled at the theme of romance. Similarly, the
        title character's relationship with his first son, Boruto, was explored
        furthermore in the 2015 film Boruto: Naruto the Movie to end Naruto's
        growth as the character had become an adult, but it was briefly shown in
        the manga's finale.
