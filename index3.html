        One-Punch Man is a Japanese superhero franchise created by the artist
        ONE. It tells the story of Saitama, a superhero who can defeat any
        opponent with a single punch but seeks to find a worthy opponent after
        growing bored by a lack of challenge due to his overwhelming strength.

      <h2>Anime</h2>
      <p>
        The first season of the anime received critical acclaim, receiving
        praise for its uniqueness, animation, humor, characters and fight
        scenes. It holds an approval rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on
        12 reviews, with the site's critics' consensus reading: "With its
        state-of-the-art animation, unorthodox hero, and gut-bustlingly funny
        jabs at the shounen genre, One-Punch Man is simply a knockout."
      </p>
      <p>
        The second season received mixed reviews. Although the humor,
        characters, and story were still praised, reviewers unanimously
        criticized the drop in the quality of the animation following the change
        of studios. The direction, pacing, and fights were also criticized, as
        was the last episode for feeling like an improper season finale. Screen
        Rant noted that fan reaction to the season was divided, with their
        response to the new animation being notably negative. They criticized
        the drop of quality in animation as well as the change of director,
        saying "One-Punch Man was previously crisp, detailed and fluid, but many
        fans claim that the latest season has felt static, bland and
        uninspiring. This is almost certainly down to a change in director. [The
        series] has gone from the pinnacle of TV anime visuals to looking like
        just another weekly series." However, they believed the season "improves
        in terms of story, character and world-building", although they mostly
        attribute this to the original manga rather than the series' crew. They
        were very critical of the season finale, noting how the anime could have
        adapted one or two extra manga chapters to offer a more conclusive
        finale and build excitement toward a third season.
      </p>
      <p>
        IGN gave season 2 a five out of ten rating, calling it "mediocre".
        Although they felt the humor and characters were on par with the first
        season, they were very critical of the animation and pacing, saying:
        "[the animation was] taking horrendous shortcuts to get the fights done
        and dusted in as simple a way as possible. Gone are the intricately
        detailed character action shots, with dynamic slow motion and
        constantly-shifting camerawork. Instead, we have flashes, cuts to black,
        and machine-gun punches all reminiscent of the drawn-out fight scenes of
        Dragon Ball Z from more than twenty years ago." They concluded saying:
        "Season 2 of One-Punch Man is a half-baked jumble of poor and lazy
        animation that is far more concerned with staying relevant than being
        crafted into something worthy of the season that came before it. If
        you're only in it for the advancement of the plot, it's all here. But
        it's also all in the manga, and that looks an awful lot better than this
        season."
